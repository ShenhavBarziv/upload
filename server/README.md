# Easy File Upload Application

This repository now contains a Node.js backend and a React (TypeScript) frontend built with Material UI. It provides a user-friendly way to upload files from any device over your local network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your PC.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the server dependencies.
4. Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.

## Usage

1. Build the TypeScript server with `npm run build`.
2. Build the frontend using `npm run client:build`. During development you can run `npm run client` to start the React dev server.
3. Start the backend with `npm start`. Set the environment variable `USE_NGROK=true` before starting if you want to expose the server publicly.
4. Once started, the terminal will display the server address and a QR code for quick access. If ngrok is enabled, a public URL will also be shown.
5. Open the address in a browser (or scan the QR code) to use the web interface.

Run `npm test` to execute the automated tests.

## Features

- **Easy File Upload**: Upload files from any device connected to the same network.
- **QR Code Access**: Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal to quickly access the web interface from your device.
- **File Management**: View and download uploaded files through the applicationâ€™s interface.
- **Public Sharing**: Set `USE_NGROK=true` to get a temporary public URL via ngrok so others can access your server.
